This project will scan ISBN number from photo, check price on allegro and put it into auction if
user want to.

TODO: 
[x] - Connect to Allegro API (as it turns out - Allegro API only serves as extension for user
operations, so atomatizing search it is not an option here)
[ ] - Integrate ISBN (and metadata from it) to get find request from Allegro
[ ] - Calculate average price/bought books from request data
[ ] - Return readable and compressed imformation

TODO (BACKEND SIDE):
[ ] - Check what is better for minimal photo app: Kotlin/Java, maybe other framework?
[ ] - Add kewl image processing (equalizing the photo perspective and stuff)
[ ] - Create server side of application (to get request from backedn side)
