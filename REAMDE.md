This project will scan ISBN number from photo, check price on allegro and put it into auction if
user want to.

TODO:

[ ] number keyboard to input ISBN number in it.
[ ] result screen made anyhow readeble
[ ] error screen - some basics but with try catch.
[ ] consistency between screens (one color only)
[ ] taking ISBN number directly from photo (in real time!)
